## Create Gemini Instance

```dart
final request = DeepRequest(
    apiKey: "--- Your Gemini Api Key --- ", // Replace this
    model: "gemini-pro"
);
```

## Generate content

With Gemini you use both text and image data for prompting, depending on what model variation you use.

For example, you can generate text using text prompt with the gemini-pro model and use both text and image data to prompt the gemini-pro-vision model

### Text only input

This feature lets you perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text completion and summarization.

```dart
request.generateText("Tell me a story").then((response){
    print(response)
})
```

### Text and image input

You can send a text prompt with an image to the gemini-pro-vision model to perform a vision related task. For example, captioning an image or identifying what's in an image.
